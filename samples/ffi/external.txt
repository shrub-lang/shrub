// Use `external` to declare type information for a function that
// will be present at runtime, but is not present at compile-time.
//
// This is mostly useful for stdlib definitions, and other functionality
// implemented in C/C++ or another language.
//
// Note that external functions are *required* to adhere to the Shrub ABI,
// or they will crash your application at runtime.
//
// When declaring external functions, you must explicitly declare type information
